### Weather-plotting-for-high-and-low-temperature-of-10-years-data
Python code which returns a line graph of the record high and record low temperatures by day of the year over the period 2005-2014. Overlaid scatter of the 2015 data for any points (highs and lows) for which the ten year record (2005-2014) record high or record low was broken in 2015.

This program will take the data.csv file which contains 10yr data and find the highest and lowest temperature for each day of the year(except 29th FEB) among the 10yr data.
The data for highest and lowest temperature could be from any one year from the 10 year data which contains the highest and lowest data.
